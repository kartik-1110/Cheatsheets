====================== Node JS ======================

===> Globals (global object) - no window
// _dirname - path to current directory
// _filename - file name
// require - function to use modules (commonJS)
// module - info about current module(file)
// process - info about where the program us being executed


===> module - every file is a module
            - Encapsulated code (only share min)

===> Built in modules
    - OS
    - PATH 
    - FS 
    - HTTP


===> Event loop in node js

Features of Event Loop:
1: Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.
2: The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task.
3: The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
4: The event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.

- Timers: Callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() or setInterval() are executed in this phase.
- Pending Callbacks: I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration are executed here.
- Idle, Prepare: Used internally only.
- Poll: Retrieves new I/O events.
- Check: It invokes setIntermediate() callbacks.
- Close Callbacks: It handles some close callbacks. Eg: socket.on(‘close’, …)


===> STREAMS - streams are data handling method and are used to read or write input in output sequentially.
- Writable
- Readable
- Duplex
- Transform


===> HTTP methods
- GET : read data
- POST : insert data
- PUT : update data
- DELETE : delete data


===> Express 
Important methods in express object:
- app.get
- app.post
- app.put 
- app.delete
- app.all 
- app.use 
- app.listen 


===> API(Aplication Programming Interface) VS SSR(Server Side Rendering)
--API
    1: API - json
    2: SEND DATA 
    3: RES.JSON()

-- SSR 
    1: TEMPLATE
    2: SEND TEMPLATE
    3: RES.RENDER()


===> Route parameters - In express, route parameters are essentially variables derived from named section of the URL. 
                        Express captures the value in the namd section and stores it in the req.params property.

// app.get('/user/userID', (req, res)=> {
    req.params
    req.json(req.params)
})                        


===> Middleware functions - These are the functions that have access to the request object(req), the response object (res) &
                            & the next Middleware function in the application's request - response cycle.
- Middleware function can perform following task: 
1: Execute any task
2: Make changes to the request and response object
3: End the request- response cycle.
4: Call the next Middleware function in the stack
